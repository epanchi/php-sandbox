# Design Patterns
- reference: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns

Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. 
Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. 

**Clasifications of patterns**
- Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
    - Factory Method :  provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singleton
- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
