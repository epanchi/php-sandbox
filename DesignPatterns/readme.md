Design patterns are a toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems in software design. 
Design patterns define a common language that you and your teammates can use to communicate more efficiently. 

## Clasifications of patterns**

### Creational patterns
Creational patterns provide object creation mechanisms that increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
#### Factory Method :  
Provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created
- Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
- The Factory Method separates product construction code from the code that actually uses the product.

    
    - Abstract Factory
    - Builder
    - Prototype
    - Singleton

- Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Behavioral patterns take care of effective communication and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
